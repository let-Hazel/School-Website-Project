        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Founded in 2020 by billionaire philanthropist Hazel Sibhuku, Athena Academy Boarding School is a scholarship-based institution committed to providing a world-class education for young African women. With a unique pay-what-you-can model, the school is maintained entirely through donations, ensuring that every contribution directly supports staff salaries and the continuous improvement of the school. Open to all African nationals, Athena Academy is proud to offer an inclusive and diverse learning environment with no religious affiliation. We believe in fostering a community where students thrive academically, creatively, and personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our curriculum stands apart by shining a spotlight on women’s contributions throughout history, science, and the arts. Subjects like history, painting, music, writing, biology, law, physics, calculus, and coding are taught by highly educated female instructors who are experts in their fields. We encourage self-sufficiency by engaging students in practical life skills such as assisting female chefs, tending to the school’s garden, and helping with livestock for milk and eggs. Chores are shared and rotated among students, cultivating a sense of responsibility and community.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Athena Academy, we foster leadership, creativity, and personal growth. Students participate in outdoor learning experiences, from science experiments to physical education and artistic activities. The school uniform is designed for comfort and freedom of movement, encouraging an active lifestyle. Clubs are student-led, empowering girls to explore their interests. Our mentorship program pairs each student with a younger peer, fostering a supportive sisterhood that builds confidence and camaraderie across grade levels.
