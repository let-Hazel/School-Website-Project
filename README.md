# School-Website-Project
A simple, five-page website for a fictional school called Athena Academy

The Website is coded entirely in css and html, it was coded on VS Code and added on Github as a file
It uses css properties like positioning, hovering, box properties e.t.c
the css file is linked from a different folder, so are the pictures.
